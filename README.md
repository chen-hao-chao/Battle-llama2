# Battle-llama2
## Story


## Background
Since I learned how to write a game program using C language with allegro, I have written a lot of games such as Battle-llama-1, Early-Spring and Aceoawhole. 
I found that "complicated" doesn't correspond to "exquisite". Instead, simple and intuitive games are more acceptable to players. 
As a result, I chose Battle-llama, which is not only my first C language game project but also a simple easy game, to revise and build this new version. 
I used a game window and five pages as the trunk, one useful type and four objects as twigs to build this project, and you can see more detail in the file I uploaded in the front page.
