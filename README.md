# Battle-llama2

## Introduction
Since I learned how to write a game program using C language with allegro, I have written a lot of games such as Battle-llama-1, Early-Spring and Aceoawhole. 
I found that "complicated" doesn't correspond to "exquisite". Instead, simple and intuitive games are more acceptable to players. 
As a result, I chose Battle-llama, which is not only my first C language game project but also a simple easy game, to revise and build this new version. 
I used a game window and five pages as the trunk, one useful type and four objects as twigs to build this project, and you can see more detail in the file I uploaded in the front page.

## Story
This is a story about two llamas. 
In the first version, they both want to be the PQ(party queen), so they have no choice to have a fierce fight. 
But in this version, something different. There are three different powers hidden in the llamas' body. 
The players' goal is to activate this power and defeat your enemy.
